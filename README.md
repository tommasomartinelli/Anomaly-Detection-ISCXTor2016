# Anomaly-Detection_ISCXTor2016
*Intelligent and Secure Network* examination project.

## Overview
This project is dedicated to the task of anomaly detection, specifically targeting the identification of TOR (The Onion Router) traffic through the implementation of unsupervised models.

## Data
The dataset used in this project, ISCXTor2016, is sourced from the Canadian Institute of Cybersecurity. It contains over 60,000 samples of real network traffic, including both TOR and nonTOR instances. You can find the dataset in the "Dataset" folder of this repository. https://www.unb.ca/cic/datasets/tor.html 

## Code
The repository includes a comprehensive Jupyter notebook available in the "Notebooks" section. This notebook covers the entire process of TOR traffic detection using unsupervised models. It encompasses data loading, exploratory data analysis (EDA), model training, and evaluation. The code is extensively commented to facilitate understanding and further exploration.

## Presentation
Discover a comprehensive overview of the project in Italian through a PowerPoint presentation available in the "Doc" folder. The presentation elucidates the project's objectives, methods, and findings, providing an exploration of the anomaly detection process for TOR traffic.

## Usage
The primary way to interact with this project is through the Jupyter notebook provided in the "Notebooks" section. Follow these steps to run the notebook:

1. Ensure you have Python 3.8 or higher installed on your system.
2. Install the required dependencies by running.
3. Execute each cell in the notebook sequentially to perform tasks such as data loading, exploratory data analysis, model training, and evaluation.

### Model Deployment
The trained models can be used for TOR traffic detection in various scenarios. You can integrate the models into your own projects or systems that require anomaly detection. Feel free to experiment with different configurations or extend the models for specific use cases.

### Custom Configurations
Explore different configurations, experiment with hyperparameters, or try alternative unsupervised models to adapt the project to your specific needs. The provided code is extensively commented to guide you through the customization process.
